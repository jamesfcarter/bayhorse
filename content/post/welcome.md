Friends Of The Bay Horse is a Community Benefit Society formed with the aim of buying the Bay Horse in Murton and running it as a community venture.

We've secured more than £100,000 from the Plunkett Foundation towards buying the property, and we're intending to raise the remaining money from the community.  Together we'll run the pub as a community venture, reinvesting profits and paying interest to investors.

Join us today by purchasing shares from £200, and you can own part of
York’s next community success story.
