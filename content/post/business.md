Friends Of The Bay Horse will revitalise the pub through direct management rather than tenancy. We aim to employ an experienced live-in management couple and staff.  We believe this will give us the best choice of potential manager, and ensure its long-term success.

Our revenue model for the first year is pessimistic, and is working on only a gradual uplift on the current turnover of £100,000. Nevertheless we’ll be able to budget for:

* A 4% return to investors;
* Free wireless internet for customers;
* Annual community events at Easter, Bonfire Night and
* Christmas; AND
* A consistent marketing budget.
