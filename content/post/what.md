**It will become a true community centre** for Murton and surrounding
area - with new facilities such as a village shop and free wifi from day 1.

**It will become a free house** - the pub’s lower costs allow us to turn a
profit after 18 months, paying interest to shareholders in the mean time.

**It will be community-run** - there’ll be no lease, no tenant, no other
owner. We have the final say on how it’s run.

**It will become a destination** - our business plan includes funding for
special events, bringing back good times that the locals remember.
